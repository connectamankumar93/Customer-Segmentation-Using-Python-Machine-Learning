# Customer Segmentation using Python & Machine-Learning

The aim of this Project is to classify customer in segments based on their purchasing behavior. The project is divided into four parts: 

Part 1 involves Cohort Analysis (Size Cohort) i.e capturing the data that how many new customers are being acquired every month & how are they behaving for the next 12 months in terms of retention, average buying count. 

Part 2 involves Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value Analysis (RFM Analysis) of the customers using the given data & basis the RMF score analysis we segmented the customer into 3 major segments namely Bronze, Silver & Gold. 

Part 3 involves Pre-processing of the given data in terms of logarithmic transformation & Standard scaling for feeding into KMeans Clustering Model. 

Part 4  involves Running the K-Means Clustering algorithm on the processed data and basis Recency , Buying Frequency , Monetary Value (count & sum) the customers were segmented into 3 clusters.
